/**
 * {@code AttributedShape} holds a Graphics2D {@link Shape} alongside related
 * attribute information. Only the most basic attributes are modeled at this
 * time, such as pen color, Draw Mode, and the transform to apply to a shape
 * that is defined at the origin. Specialty attributes such as stroke, and
 * layers, are often temporal and thus aren't modeled in this class.
 * <p>
 * The data members are currently declared as public, simply because they are
 * expected to be accessed in performance-sensitive tight loops during bulk
 * graphics operations. This class was written before Functional Programming
 * concepts were introduced to Java, so it is a candidate for refactoring.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, this class is currently modeled primarily as one that is
 * instantiated and then left as-is. This is due to its original purpose being
 * to serve as a container for shapes and their attributes while importing
 * graphics from file formats such as AutoCAD DXF. If the need arises, we can
 * add getter and setter methods, and consider making the data private.
